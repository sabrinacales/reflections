When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

=> Using a remote repository is good practice for backing up your machine. Also, when you are collaboratively working on a project, it's a good idea to use a remote repository. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

=> If there are others that have permission to change the repo you might want to check that all of the changes are sensical. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

=> A fork is used in GitHub to copy and make changes to an existing repo. A branch is made on a local repo in addition to the main (master) branch to test out new features and can be reintegrated after having made several commits on both the branch and master. A clone is an exact copy of a local or remote repo. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

=> If you are working collaboratively, you want to make sure you have the most up-to-date version of the remote repo, so you can avoid conflicts with your remote and local repos. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

=> If you want to collaborate on text rather than code, dropbox and google drive are good options. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
