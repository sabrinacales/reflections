What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

=> Initializing a git repository tells git that this is a new repository. You need to do it so that git can create the repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

=> The staging area is a place where you can load files before you commit them to the repository. It allows you to select which files you want in your repository.
